# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## Installation

Node and Inquirer must be installed in order for the application to run and function correctly. Additionally, you can also install jest if you would like to test if the application works without generating an image.

## Usage

Open the integrated terminal for the "index.js" file. Once open, enter "node index.js" in the terminal's command line. You will then be met with prompts that will allow you to configure your own personal .svg logo. Enter "npm run test" if you would just to see that this application works properly.

## Credits

I authored this code with the help of the coursework for this module from Wash U in Saint Louis Coding Bootcamp, Stack Overflow, and W3Schools. 

## User Story

As a freelance web developer I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for text

THEN I can enter up to three characters

WHEN I am prompted for the text color

THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I am prompted for a shape

THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square

WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color

THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts

THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`

AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser

THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
